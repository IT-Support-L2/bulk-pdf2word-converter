# bulk-pdf2word-converter
Bulk Pdf2Word Converter coded with Python 3.9.0 and tkinter. 

GUI designed with PAGE but I modified most part
of the generated code. 


Bulk pdf2word let you convert mutliple pdf files with high quality and 100% precision in few seconds.


- What should I input in Files Directory Entry?

 You should input the directory of your pdf files folder.


 - Correct input: `C:/Users/user/Desktop/folder/`

 * Important: A front-slash `/` must be at the end of the directory!

 - Wrong input: `C:\Users\user\Desktop\folder\`


 - Best practice:


   Put your pdf files you are willing to convert in a single folder,

   then input its directory exactly like explained above.


   Each doc file will take the filename of its correspondent pdf file.
    
   
   To successfully compile the code into Windows executable, while you are in the pdf2word.py directory run:

   `pyinstaller --noconsole pdf2word.py`  
   
   or simply install it using the provided setup.
